# Text-classification-using-Python
In this application, we are working on BBC press releases in order to predict, based on the textual content of a press article, whether it belongs to a given category (Business, Sport, Politics, etc.). To do this, we used three types of classifiers: (i) Multinominal Na√Øve Bayes, (ii) K-Nearest Neighbors, and (iii) Support Vector Machine.
